\title{Merge HFD Service Data}
\usage{
merge_hfd_service_data(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{An object of class `hfd_data`, as returned by [read_hfd_data()].}
}
\value{
A tibble with merged service data. If more than one service sheet is
  present, they are joined on the columns `district`, `year`, and `month`. If
  no service sheets are found, the function returns `NULL`.
}
\description{
Merges multiple service-related sheets from an `hfd_data` object by
**district**, **year**, and **month**.
}
\details{
The function first filters out non-service sheets (e.g., `Admin_data` and
`Population_data`) and removes any NULL or empty data. Then it uses
[left_join()] to progressively merge all service sheets into one.
}
